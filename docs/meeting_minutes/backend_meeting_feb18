Meeting Agenda:
-Identify API Routes needed from Spotify API 

Activities Undertaken:
- Identified API Routes needed from Spotify API including: create playlist, add items to playlist, update playlist, get album, get album tracks and get artist 
- Access token 
- Decided to remove user_moves table from Database 
- Decided to store user moves using cookies instead of in database

Additional Notes Regarding Backend: 
- Access token is only available for 1 hour at a time
- Refresh token is available as long as app is running 
- Anything that requires modifying user data needs a different token (update playlist is one of those API calls that requires user token)
- getArtist has a getArtistAlbums as part of it, using getArtist or getAlbums is a decision we need to make as we develop 

Next Steps: 
- Do full mapping of database 

Upcoming Deadlines: 
- Project Proposal Due: 3/7/2025
