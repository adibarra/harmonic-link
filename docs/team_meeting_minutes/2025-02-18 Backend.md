## Meeting Agenda

- Identify API Routes needed from Spotify API

## Activities Undertaken

- Identified API Routes needed from Spotify API, including:
  - create playlist
  - add items to playlist
  - update playlist
  - get album
  - get album tracks
  - get artist
- Access token management discussed.
- Decided to remove the user_moves table from the database.
- Decided to store user moves using cookies instead of in the database.

## Additional Notes Regarding Backend

- Access token is only available for 1 hour at a time.
- Refresh token is available as long as the app is running.
- Modifying user data requires a different token (e.g., update playlist requires user token).
- `getArtist` has `getArtistAlbums` as part of it; using `getArtist` or `getAlbums` will be a decision to make as development progresses.

## Next Steps

- Do full mapping of the database.

## Upcoming Deadlines

- Project Proposal - **Due:** 2025/03/07
